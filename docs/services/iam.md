# IAM

floci-gcp emulates Google Cloud IAM over REST JSON using the real GCP IAM API.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FLOCI_GCP_SERVICES_IAM_ENABLED` | `true` | Enable/disable IAM |
| `FLOCI_GCP_SERVICES_IAM_AUTHORIZATION_MODE` | `disabled` | IAM allow-policy evaluation mode. `disabled` preserves no-auth behavior; `enforce` evaluates supported GCS REST bucket and object operations |
| `FLOCI_GCP_SERVICES_IAM_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_MEMBER` | unset | Optional IAM member granted `roles/storage.admin` on each newly created bucket |

`authorization-mode` defaults to `disabled`. IAM policy storage and policy-shaped
responses remain available in that mode, but they do not restrict requests. In
`enforce` mode, bucket `testIamPermissions` returns only permissions granted
by the stored bucket policy. Bucket metadata, bucket IAM-policy, retention-lock,
storage-layout, and notification operations are also checked against their
documented bucket permissions. JSON/XML object reads, writes, updates, deletes,
listing, compose, copy, rewrite, move, restore, and resumable uploads are checked
against the documented object permissions. Restore requires `storage.objects.restore`
and `storage.objects.create`, plus `storage.objects.delete` when it replaces a live
object. ACL operations are not restricted by IAM allow policies.

The initial role catalog supports `roles/storage.objectViewer`,
`roles/storage.objectCreator`, `roles/storage.objectAdmin`, and
`roles/storage.admin` for the explicitly enforced permissions. Bucket policies
inherit to objects. Conditions support `resource.name` equality,
`startsWith`, `endsWith`, and timestamp comparisons; regex, `extract`,
macros, and undeclared attributes are rejected.

Object-list conditions authorize the bucket-level `storage.objects.list`
permission but do not filter returned objects. ACLs, signed-URL identity,
project policies, deny policies, custom roles, groups, and the full UBLA
lifecycle remain outside this evaluator. Conditional bindings require UBLA, and a
bucket update cannot disable, remove, or partially clear UBLA while conditional
bindings remain configured. Downscoped tokens cannot use enforce mode until
IAM-aware principal propagation is enabled.

## Enforcement bootstrap

When Floci can resolve a new bucket's caller from a valid Floci-issued
impersonated token, it persists a bucket-level `roles/storage.admin` binding for
that service-account member. This lets the creator manage the bucket after the
emulator is started with `authorization-mode: enforce`.

For callers without a resolvable identity, set
`FLOCI_GCP_SERVICES_IAM_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_MEMBER` to an IAM member such as
`serviceAccount:admin@example.iam.gserviceaccount.com`. That member receives
`roles/storage.admin` on every subsequently created bucket. Treat this setting
as an administrator credential: it is deliberately powerful, and an `allUsers`
value makes every new bucket publicly manageable. The setting accepts only
`serviceAccount:` members, `allAuthenticatedUsers`, or `allUsers`.

## Quick Start

=== "gcloud CLI"

    ```bash
    gcloud config set project floci-local

    # Create a service account
    gcloud iam service-accounts create my-sa \
        --display-name="My Service Account"

    # List service accounts
    gcloud iam service-accounts list

    # Create a key
    gcloud iam service-accounts keys create key.json \
        --iam-account=my-sa@floci-local.iam.gserviceaccount.com

    # Delete a key
    gcloud iam service-accounts keys delete KEY_ID \
        --iam-account=my-sa@floci-local.iam.gserviceaccount.com
    ```

=== "REST API"

    ```bash
    # Create service account
    curl -X POST http://localhost:4588/v1/projects/floci-local/serviceAccounts \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"accountId":"my-sa","serviceAccount":{"displayName":"My SA"}}'

    # List service accounts
    curl http://localhost:4588/v1/projects/floci-local/serviceAccounts

    # Get service account
    curl http://localhost:4588/v1/projects/floci-local/serviceAccounts/my-sa@floci-local.iam.gserviceaccount.com

    # Delete service account
    curl -X DELETE http://localhost:4588/v1/projects/floci-local/serviceAccounts/my-sa@floci-local.iam.gserviceaccount.com
    ```

## Service Accounts

Service accounts follow the GCP naming convention:

```
projects/{project}/serviceAccounts/{account}@{project}.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

## Service Account Keys

```bash
# Create key
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:4588/v1/projects/floci-local/serviceAccounts/my-sa@floci-local.iam.gserviceaccount.com/keys \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'

# List keys
curl http://localhost:4588/v1/projects/floci-local/serviceAccounts/my-sa@floci-local.iam.gserviceaccount.com/keys
```

## IAM Policy Bindings

```bash
# Grant Secret Manager access to a service account
gcloud secrets add-iam-policy-binding my-secret \
    --member="serviceAccount:my-sa@floci-local.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
    --role="roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor"
```

## Sign Blob (V4 Signed URLs)

The IAM `SignBlob` endpoint is used by the GCS SDK to generate V4 pre-signed URLs:

```java
URL signedUrl = storage.signUrl(
    BlobInfo.newBuilder("my-bucket", "hello.txt").build(),
    15, TimeUnit.MINUTES,
    Storage.SignUrlOption.withV4Signature());
```

`SignBlob` accepts the bytes to sign and returns a stub signature, which is sufficient for local development.

## Supported Operations

- `CreateServiceAccount`
- `GetServiceAccount`
- `ListServiceAccounts`
- `DeleteServiceAccount`
- `CreateServiceAccountKey` (real RSA-2048 key pair; returns JSON key file)
- `GetServiceAccountKey`
- `ListServiceAccountKeys`
- `DeleteServiceAccountKey`
- `GetIamPolicy`
- `SetIamPolicy`
- `TestIamPermissions`
- `SignBlob`

## Related: Service Account Impersonation

`generateAccessToken` (the `iamcredentials.googleapis.com` API used by `ImpersonatedCredentials`) is provided by the separate [IAM Credentials service](iam-credentials.md), toggled with `FLOCI_GCP_SERVICES_IAMCREDENTIALS_ENABLED`.
